#nested loop A nested loop means a loop inside another loop.
#Each time the outer loop runs once, the inner loop runs completely.
#it can be used to see all posiible data combinatiom
#the outer loop is slower e.g a
#medium loop is medium e.g b
#inner loop is faster and runs through the other loop e.g 
#using nested loops for crossing data
for x in range(3): #outer loop
    for y in range(2): #inner loop
        for z in range(2):
            print(f"({x}, {y}, {z}")
